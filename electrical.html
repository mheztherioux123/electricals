      <h2>Non-working Outlet</h2>
      <p>Start by checking if the outlet is receiving power. Use a voltage tester to confirm if the wires are live.</p>
      <p>If there's no power, check the circuit breaker panel for any tripped breakers. Reset any tripped breakers.</p>
      <p>If power is reaching the outlet, the issue may lie with the outlet itself. Turn off the power to the circuit and remove the outlet cover.</p>
      <p>Inspect the wiring connections at the outlet. Make sure all wires are securely connected to the appropriate terminals. Tighten any loose screws.</p>
      <p>If the outlet is damaged or faulty, replace it with a new one. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation.</p>
